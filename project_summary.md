This way the user becomes co-author of the piece, Using posts, tweets and retweets redesigning the scene with different timelines and hashtags.

Relationship between people and technolgy is bluring,who is controlling what?
Technology is meant to be an extension of our creative intelligence not a limitation.

Using the decentralized universe of tagging, collective intelligence becomes the key conecept and provides unfocused way to deliver content, a person located in Paris can become a remote artist,sending a tweet and contributing with the piece located in London.
