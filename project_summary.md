# Morph-On : Remote Artist

## Author
- Didier Cabrera

## Description

We are now living in a world in which every day we are bombarded with pictures of our friend's food, duckfaces, selfies, lyrics of songs or a Marilyn Monroe picture with a random quote, but the most annoying...Hashtags!

So why not to put an artistic aproach to this way of comunicating or poluting with info.

Morph-On is a non-tangible interface to transform, control or generate audio and visuals from user interaction in social networks, or activity on the web.
This way the user becomes co-author of the piece.

Even a person located in Paris can become a remote artist,sending a tweet and contributing with the piece located in London.
