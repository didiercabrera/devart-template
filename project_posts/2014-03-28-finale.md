So heres the simple interface to set the Hashtags to track

![Tracker](../project_images/webinterface.PNG?raw=true "Tracker")

You can set up to 3 hashtags and also you can use the top search box to make a google search and create notes from the resulst.

When tweets are received, the remote artist section shows up and displays every tweet.
