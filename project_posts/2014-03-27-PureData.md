## PureData

So here is the basic and small Pure Data patch,I have one MIDI Input,which is the keyboard controller, and this is sending MIDI Data to the DAW but also sending it to the nodejs server receiving OSC.

This small piece is receiving OSC sent by the nodejs app running which is creating controllers from internet.

Because I'm Using windows, a MIDI virtual port is necessary, I used Midiyoke,but also tested LoopMidi, I'm not incluiding the binaries so google them.

The controller I'm using is a MIDI Keyboard
