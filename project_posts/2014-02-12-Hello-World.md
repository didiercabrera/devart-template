We are now living in a world in which every day we are bombarded with pictures of our friend's food, duckfaces, selfies, lyrics of songs or a Marilyn Monroe picture with a random quote, but the most annoying...Hashtags!

So why not to put an artistic aproach to this way of comunicating or poluting with info.

## Background

If you look for the meaning of *Morph* (google it right now) this shows up: 

**Biology**: *An individual with various forms*
**Verb**: *To or to be transformed*
**Linguistics**: *a sequence of sounds or letters constituting the physical realization of a morpheme in a specific context*

[Morpheme From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme)

So,social networks like Twitter or g+ are ecosystems of living organisms called tweets and posts, ones can be part of a whole meaning and have the abilty to change in every retweet or repost, and others simply lack of a smart sentence! (no ofense)

What if this tweet becomes an agent of art? Why not use it to create something others can enjoy?

## Morphing

What is a chair? An object in which a person can sit right?
And a table? Something where you can eat and place your food,or support something else.
So if you sit on top of a table,is it a chair or a table?

## The Process

Imagine a room with a set of speakers, and a projection set,empty, then a tweet comes in,Sound and Visuals react with the content of that tweet. Or some random guy tweets about Pink Floyd and instantly you hear and see the dark side of the moon.

Every sound will be controled or generated from tweets and posts,and with every retweet the sound grows and gets louder.Visuales could be generated from images the users are providing.
