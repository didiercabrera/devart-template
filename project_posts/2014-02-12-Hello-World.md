## Hello Noise

We are now living in a world in which every day we are bombarded with pictures of our friend's food, duckfaces, selfies, lyrics of songs or a Marilyn Monroe picture with a random quote.
We see all around people walking like zombies,looking nothing but their phones,we see it at concerts,movies,sports events,people are more conected but very distant, losing interaction with each other and with artists, if you go to a party, people are constantly taking pictures of themselves but forgetting to dance.

## Background

If you look for the meaning of *Morph* (google it right now) this shows up: 

**Biology**: *An individual with various forms*
**Verb**: *To or to be transformed*
**Linguistics**: *a sequence of sounds or letters constituting the physical realization of a morpheme in a specific context*

[Morpheme From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme)

So,social networks like Twitter or g+ are ecosystems of living organisms called tweets and posts, ones can be part of a whole meaning and have the abilty to change in every retweet or repost, and others simply lack of a smart sentence! (no ofense).What if this tweet becomes an agent of art? Why not use it to create something others can enjoy?

## The Process

A room with a set of speakers, and a projection set,empty, then a tweet comes in,Sound and Visuals react with the content of that tweet. Or some random guy tweets about Pink Floyd and instantly you hear and see the dark side of the moon.

The idea is to transform social networks mentions and posts into a Global Controller and let people be part of you set.

Every sound will be controlled or generated from tweets and posts,and with every retweet the sound grows and gets louder.Visuals could be generated from images the users are providing.

## Morphing

What is a chair? An object in which a person can sit right?
And a table? Something where you can eat and place your food,or support something else.
So if you sit on top of a table,is it a chair or a table?
My point is that everything can be used and reused in so many ways they are not meant to.

I'll upload a video soon.
