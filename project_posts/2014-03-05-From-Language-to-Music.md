## From Language to Music

To begin with, music is another type of language. A paragraph or an essay is made up sentences,and each sentence made up of words.And Each word is a set of letters which are predefined in the alphabet.

In music this alphabet is a note scale, if you take some notes and put them together you got a chord.

## Tweets as musical notation

This is how it works: Each post is decomposed into words and this words are now chords.

Using each letter to represent a note, a word can sound different now.
Getting each letter's index in the alphabet and using it as a MIDI Note number.

For example: *Awesome, this is my post* , this will be an array of words: [Awesome,this,is,my,post] , and each element is a new chord

*a* has index of 0 in the alphabet which is a *C0* note in the Note Table below.

The word **Awesome** is represented by the group of notes : **C0,A1,D#0,F1,C#1,B0,D#0**
