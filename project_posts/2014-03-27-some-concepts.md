Here are some concepts I used on my posts

*DAW* (Digital Audio Work station) 

*OSC* (Open Sound Control) 

*MIDI* (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) This can be confusing but MIDI is not a type of sound,or type of audio. MIDI is a system that allows electronic music instruments and computers to send instructions to each other.

*MIDI Controller* When you play a MIDI Instrument,it produces data that can be used with any sequencer. When a device comunicates with another its just one device telling the other what to do.

So anything can be controller
