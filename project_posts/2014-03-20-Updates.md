Lets say We have a text from a document or post and want to use it to create music,and we have a set of words we want them to emulate buttons or sliders,or just use every word and letter as a note

```javascript
var controlify=require('controlify');
controlify.setProperties({
		controllers:{
			buttons:{play:120,stop:121,pause:122},
			sliders:{delay:104,reverb:105,flanger:102}
		},
		notes:{
			scale:{"A":57,"A#":58,"B":59,"C":60,"C#":61,"D":62,"D#":63,"E":64,"F":65,"F#":66,"G":67,"G#":68}
		}	
	});

var text="this is so awesome, making music with text,play some music and add some reverb!";	

var notes=controlify.createNotes(text,{
	type:'scale',
	octave:2
});

var sliders=controlify.createControllers(text,{type:'sliders'});
var buttons=controlify.createControllers(text,{type:'buttons'});

```
The controllers being set, are predefined inside the module but you can use your own,

The variable notes is an array of notes created from the text using the chromatic scale and searching for Note Letters in each word.Creating notes from 'Hello' will be only one note because the only letter used in the scale is 'e'. But if we want to be more creative lets use the whole alphabet.

Yo can see my previous post to get an idea.

And we can then send the notes and controllers

```javascript
controlify.sendNotes(notes,{
	tempo:127,
	duration:3
});

for( i in sliders){
	var cc=sliders[i];
	console.log(cc)
	controlify.autoControl(cc,
	{
		min:10,
		max:25,
		tempo:120
	});
}
```

We can send controllers and notes one time or use the **autoControl** method to emulate someone turning a knob or slider.
